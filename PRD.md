# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Name

DevSync

## Product Type

Repository-Based Real-Time Development Workspace

---

## 1. Product Overview

DevSync is a web-based collaborative development platform that allows multiple users to work on the same project repository in real time.

Unlike traditional workflows where developers exchange ZIP files or continuously push and pull changes from repositories, DevSync provides a live shared workspace where all project files and code changes are synchronized instantly across team members.

The platform acts as a central workspace for project collaboration, enabling teams to create repositories, manage files, collaborate on code, and export projects for local execution.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Team-based software development often becomes difficult for students and beginner developers due to project synchronization issues.

Common challenges include:

* Project files are stored separately on each team member's computer.
* Developers frequently exchange ZIP files to share updates.
* Team members must repeatedly push and pull changes to stay synchronized.
* Multiple versions of the same project may exist across different systems.
* New contributors often struggle with Git-based collaboration workflows.

These issues reduce productivity and create coordination problems during project development.

---

## 3. Proposed Solution

DevSync provides a centralized repository-based workspace where multiple collaborators can work on the same project simultaneously.

Every project exists as a shared workspace on the platform.

Any action performed by one collaborator is instantly visible to all connected members, including:

* File creation
* File deletion
* File renaming
* Folder management
* Code modifications

This ensures that all team members always work on the latest version of the project.

Projects can be exported as ZIP files and executed locally using any preferred development environment such as VS Code.

## 4. Target Users

### Primary Users

* College students working on group projects
* Hackathon teams
* Beginner developers
* Remote development teams

### Secondary Users

* Coding mentors
* Project supervisors
* Technical trainers

---

## 5. Product Goals

### Goal 1

Eliminate manual project synchronization.

### Goal 2

Provide real-time collaboration inside project repositories.

### Goal 3

Create a centralized workspace for team development.

### Goal 4

Reduce dependency on file sharing methods such as ZIP exchange.

### Goal 5

Improve project coordination among team members.

---

## 6. Core Concept

Every project is represented as a Repository Workspace.

Example:

Repository:
E-Commerce Project

Members:

* Priyan
* Rahul
* Akash

Project Structure:

src/
├── App.js
├── Navbar.js
└── Login.js

All collaborators view and edit the same repository in real time.

---

## 7. Core Features (MVP)

### Authentication

Users can:

* Register
* Login
* Logout

---

### Repository Management

Users can:

* Create Repository
* Delete Repository
* Open Repository
* View Repository List

---

### Collaborator Management

Repository owners can:

* Invite Members
* Remove Members
* View Collaborators

---

### File Management

Users can:

* Create Files
* Delete Files
* Rename Files
* Create Folders
* Delete Folders

---

### Real-Time Synchronization

The system must synchronize:

* File Creation
* File Deletion
* File Rename
* Folder Operations
* Code Changes

Across all connected collaborators instantly.

---

### Online Presence

Users can see:

* Active Members
* Connected Members

Inside the repository workspace.

---

### Repository Persistence

All repository data must be stored in the database.

Users should be able to:

* Close Repository
* Reopen Repository Later

Without losing project data.

---

### Export Repository

Users can export an entire repository as a ZIP file.

Exported projects can be opened and executed locally using tools such as:

* VS Code
* IntelliJ IDEA
* PyCharm
* Any local development environment

---
